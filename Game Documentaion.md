Game Description:
Dinner with an Owl is a suspenseful and immersive text-based horror game. You play as Mr. Webb, a sophisticated businessman visiting the enigmatic mansion of Franz Brown, a host with a dark secret: he has the head of an owl. As you arrive, you quickly realize that this is no ordinary dinner party. Other guests seem trapped, and you must navigate the eerie mansion, make critical decisions, and uncover secrets to escape before becoming one of the mansion’s permanent "guests."

The game's atmosphere is tense and surreal, with every decision influencing your fate. Do you dare taste the strange dish? Will you investigate mysterious whispers about a key or trust cryptic hints from the staff? The choices you make determine whether you escape the mansion or are forever trapped.

Game Mechanics:
Event-Based Choices:
Players are presented with a series of narrative events, each offering two choices. Your decisions determine the outcome of the story, with incorrect choices leading to your doom.

Example:
A guest whispers to you about a hidden key in the library. Do you investigate or stay seated?
Exploration Phase:
After surviving dinner, you gain the opportunity to explore different parts of the mansion, such as the library, hallway, or basement. Each area holds clues or tools necessary for your escape.

Example:
In the library, you may find a hidden key.
